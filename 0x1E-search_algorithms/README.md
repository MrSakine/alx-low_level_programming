Search Algorithms implementation through C

## Linear search algorithm

A linear search is the simplest approach employed to search for an element in a data set. It examines each element until it finds a match, starting at the beginning of the data set, until the end. The search is finished and terminated once the target element is located. [More info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_search)

## Binary search algorithm

A binary search, also known as half-interval search, logarithmic search, or binary chop, is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. [More info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm)

## Jump search

A jump Search is an algorithm for finding a specific value in a sorted array by jumping through certain steps in the array. [More info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jump_search)
